# Guess The Number
This is a very simple Python 3 program which chooses a number the "player" is supposed to guess.

It can be found in Al Swigiart's book, **INVENT YOUR OWN COMPUTER GAMES WITH PYTHON.**

I don't know how much more there is to say. It's kinda the Karen of video games, but it involves a lot of neat programming thingies that I'm interested in improving. :-D
